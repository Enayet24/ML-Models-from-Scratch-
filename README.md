# ML-Models-from-Scratch-
## 🧩About

This repository includes implementations of some traditional machine learning models. Each of the models were **developed entirely from scratch**, without the use of high-level machine learning libraries such as `scikit-learn`. The primary motivation behind this approach is to achieve a deeper conceptual understanding of the underlying mathematics and learning mechanisms of these models.

All implementations emphasize clarity, step-by-step computation, and alignment with theoretical formulations commonly taught in academic machine learning courses.

### 📐 Design Philosophy

The models implemented from scratch follow these core principles:

- No use of machine learning libraries  
- Heavy reliance on mathematical formulation and derivation  
- Explicit implementation of loss functions, gradients, and update rules  
- Use of basic libraries (NumPy, Pandas etc) only  
- Clear and readable code structure suitable for beginners and academic learning  

This ensures that each model can be directly mapped to its theoretical description in textbooks and lecture materials.

### 🔬 Educational Significance

Implementing models from scratch provides several academic benefits:

- Strengthens understanding of optimization and learning dynamics  
- Clarifies the role of each mathematical component in model performance  
- Builds intuition for debugging and improving machine learning systems  
- Serves as a foundation for understanding deep learning frameworks  

These implementations are particularly useful for beginners seeking to get a deep understanding of these selected Machine Learning concepts, helping to strengten their basic understanding before transitioning to advanced frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.
